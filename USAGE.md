# How to Use the Travel Experience Generator

This project is now a "Master Template". You can turn it into a luxury travel site for *any* destination in minutes.

## The Core Files

1.  **`PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`** (The Instruction Manual)
    *   **What it is:** A pre-written system prompt for an AI.
    *   **How to use:** Copy this file's content. Paste it into a chat with an AI (like me or another model). Replace the placeholder destination (e.g., "7 Days in Kyoto"). The AI will generate a block of Javascript code.

2.  **`src/data/itineraryData.js`** (The Fuel)
    *   **What it is:** The single file that contains ALL the text, images, and links for the website.
    *   **How to use:** Paste the Javascript code generated by the Agent into this file, completely overwriting the old content.

## The Workflow

1.  **Generate**: Feed `PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` to an AI. Get the code.
2.  **Inject**: Paste the code into `src/data/itineraryData.js`.
3.  **Launch**: Run `npm run dev`.

**That's it.** The `App.jsx`, `Footer.jsx`, and all styling (`index.css`) will automatically adapt to display your new content with the "Narendra Experience" luxury branding.
